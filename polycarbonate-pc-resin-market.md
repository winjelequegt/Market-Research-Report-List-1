<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polycarbonate (PC) Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phosgene</li><li>Non-Phosgene</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The polycarbonate (PC) resin market is primarily segmented into two types based on the production process: phosgene and non-phosgene methods. Phosgene-derived PC resins involve the reaction of bisphenol A with phosgene gas, resulting in high-quality materials with excellent transparency and impact resistance. In contrast, non-phosgene processes utilize alternative chemical pathways, such as melt-transesterification, to produce polycarbonates without the use of hazardous phosgene. Each type caters to different industrial needs, balancing cost-effectiveness and safety concerns.</p></p>
