<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gel Anti-stick Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Gel Anti-stick Barrier Market is divided into two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable barriers. Absorbable barriers are designed to dissolve in the body over time, reducing the risk of adhesions while minimizing long-term foreign material presence. In contrast, non-absorbable barriers remain intact, providing persistent protection against adhesions but necessitating surgical removal if they cause complications. Both types aim to enhance surgical outcomes by preventing tissue sticking post-operation, ultimately improving patient recovery and comfort.</p></p>
